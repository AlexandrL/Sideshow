Sideshow is a powerful javascript library which aims to reduce your user's learning curve by providing a way to create step-by-step interactive helps. Explain the features of your application, control your end-user's interaction with your UI, use Markdown to create formatted step descriptions, emphasize what you're explaning in each step (a button, grid, dropdown, form, the whole screen, and so forth) by surrounding it with a fully adaptable mask. Just think! The sky is the limit!
